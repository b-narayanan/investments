Please provide the following information:

1. Your name and account number,
2. The dollar amount of the suspected error, and
3. A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about; please explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information. Please note:

We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the first account statement on which the problem or error appeared. If you tell us verbally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question; for errors involving new accounts or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error (new accounts may take up to 20 days). However, if we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. If we determine at the conclusion of the investigation that there was no error, we will charge your account for the credited amount. We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

## MARGIN ACCOUNT

If you are a customer with a margin account, you consent to JP Morgan's right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

## Important Information about Your Account Statement(s)

Unless otherwise indicated, accounts are held at J.P. Morgan Securities, LLC (JPMS), member FINRA and SIPC. JPMS is not a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

JPMS brokerage accounts are non-discretionary and all investment decisions are made by the client. For managed accounts, discretionary services are provided by JPMS, an affiliate or an authorized third party. NON-DISCRETIONARY:

ACCOUNT PROTECTION: As a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), JPMS provides account protection for the net equity of a customers funds and securities positions. SIPC provides $500,000 of primary net equity protection, including $250,000 for claims for cash (SIPC Coverage). Account protection applies when a SIPC member firm fails financially and is unable to meet its obligations to its securities customers, but does not apply to losses from the rise or fall in the market value of investments or to SIPC ineligible assets such as futures, options on futures, foreign exchange transactions, or any investment contracts that are not registered as securities or deposit account balances.

As used in the course of these statements, J.P. Morgan is the global brand name for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide.

The market value of your holdings is as of the last business day of the statement period or the last available price. Prices for determining market values represent estimates. These estimates are obtained from multiple sources deemed to be reliable. This information is not guaranteed for accuracy and is furnished for the exclusive use of the client. MARKET PRICES:

- J.P. Morgan makes no representation, warranty or guarantee, express or implied, that any quoted value represents the actual terms at which securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could be entered into, or the actual terms on which existing transactions or securities could be liquidated. Such values are only indicative.

Certain assets, including but not limited to, pooled and private investments, non-publicly traded and infrequently traded securities, derivatives, partnership interests and tangible assets are generally illiquid, the value of such assets may have been provided to us by third parties who may not be independent of the issuer or manager. Such information is reflected as of the last date provided to us, and is not independently verified. ESTIMATED PRICING AND COST BASIS:

Pricing estimates may be based on bids, prices within the bid offer spread, closing prices or matrix methodology that uses data relating to other securities whose prices are more ascertainable to produce a hypothetical price based on the estimated yield spread relationship between the securities. Pricing estimates do not constitute bids for any securities. Actual prices realized at sale may be more or less than those shown on your statement.

DPP and REIT securities are generally illiquid and the value of the security will, generally, be different Unpriced Direct Participation Program (DPP) and Real Estate Investment (REIT) Securities:

STATEMENT SUMMARY

from its purchase price. Accurate valuation information is not available. The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely as a general indication of performance and should not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon without the assistance of your tax advisor. With respect to security positions received into your account, cost basis information, if any, has been provided by you.  Further information is available upon request.

You may hold positions where the original cost basis has been adjusted to reflect amortization or accretion.

For Regulated Investment Companies or Dividend Reinvestment Plan sales, for which the average price method has been chosen, positions are closed out on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis.

These statements are not official documents for income tax reporting purposes and should not be relied upon for such purposes, including determination of income, cost basis, amortization or accretion, or gain/loss. Such information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with your records and your tax advisor.

Dividends credited to your account may include capital gains, non-taxable dividends and/or dividends on foreign stock. You may wish to consult your tax advisor with regard to your tax liability on these dividends. DIVIDEND INCOME:

Estimated Annual Income (EAI) is calculated by multiplying either the current coupon rate or an estimated annual dividend (generally calculated by annualizing the most recent regular cash dividend) by the quantity of the security held. For balances other than sweep program balances, Estimated Yield (EY) is calculated by dividing EAI by the market value of the security. These figures are estimates based on mathematical calculations using data obtained from outside sources. Because prices of securities, coupon and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, these estimates should not be relied upon exclusively for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. Because different asset types (e.g. equities versus fixed income securities) tend to have different investment characteristics, these estimates should not be compared across asset types. These calculations are for informational purposes only and are not a projection or guarantee of future returns. Additionally, please note that EAI and EY for certain types of Securities might include Return of Principal or Capital Gains in which case the EAI and EY would be overstated. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate EAI or EY presented. Actual income and yield might be higher or lower. Please contact us for additional information. ESTIMATED ANNUAL INCOME AND ESTIMATED YIELD:

ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online. Accordingly, investors should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price column on your statement will indicate unpriced. A description of J.P. Morgans practices and procedures regarding ARS is available at www.jpmorgan.com/muniars. IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS):

Valuations of VALUATIONS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS:

Page  16 of 18

Important Information over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various issuers of the securities, affiliates or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use.  Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction.

When we are unable to obtain a current value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate Unpriced. Although such securities may have value, please note that the value of a security indicated as Unpriced will not be included in your overall current market value as reflected on the statement. UNPRICED SECURITIES:

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares. For additional information on pricing, please see the Market Prices paragraph above. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

This statement contains (i) information obtained from multiple direct, indirect, affiliated, unaffiliated, public and proprietary data sources (including, but not limited to identifying information, market data, calculated data, reference data, valuations, ratings, coupon and dividend rates and other fundamental data) and (ii) information which is calculated based upon such information (including but not limited to, market values, Current Yield and Estimated annual income). Although your Custodian believes these sources and the sources of market values are reliable, it does not independently review or verify such information and neither your Custodian nor any source will have any duty or obligation to verify, correct, complete, or update any such information. Such information is being provided to you with all faults for use entirely at your own risk; without any warranty whatsoever by your Custodian, its affiliates or any such source. Neither your Custodian or its affiliates nor any such source shall have any liability whatsoever relating to any inaccuracy or lack of timeliness or completeness of such information or any use thereof or for omissions therefrom nor for any lost profits, indirect, special or consequential damages. Moreover, such sources retain exclusive proprietary rights in such information. You may use such information only for your internal use and purposes and not for reuse (other than in connection with the transaction or position for which the information is provided) or retransmission without prior written approval of the source, or for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION:

Interest is charged on a day by day basis for any day that there is a net debit balance in your overall account. The calculation is made on a 360-day basis at the rate or rates shown on the statement. Interest rates may be changed from time to time with fluctuating money market rates or for other reasons. METHODS OF COMPUTING INTEREST ON DEBIT BALANCES:

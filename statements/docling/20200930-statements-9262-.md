The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely for your convenience and may not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon. If you have questions related to the tax treatment of your investments, please consult your tax advisor. Unrealized gain/loss total reflects only those positions for which a cost basis is available or has been provided. J.P. Morgan has not, and cannot, validate the cost basis of positions reported by you or your agent, and are displayed solely for your convenience. Information on this statement related to cost and gain/loss calculations does not include adjustments for wash sales that may have occurred on transactions pending settlement. These wash sale adjustments, if any, will be reflected on your next statement.

For Mutual Funds, itemized cost basis displays each purchase, the aggregation of long term and short term investments, and/or the aggregation of long term and short term positions which origination cannot be determined, noted as 'Other'. For Mutual Funds, Market Value vs. Purchases is provided to assist you in comparing your total purchase, excluding reinvested distributions, with the current market value of the position. For Mutual Funds which you choose not to reinvest distributions, 'Cumulative Cash Distributions' is displayed to assist you in monitoring the position. This Cumulative Cash Distributions will only reflect cash distributions made after June 1, 2018. Investment Gain/Loss calculates the difference between your cost of Purchases from the current value of the fund, plus Cumulative Cash Distributions. In any Mutual Fund tax lot is noted 'Other' or cost basis is not available. Investment Gain/Loss will display 'Not Available.'

Investment Gain/Loss display is for informational purposes only as does not reflect your total unrealized gain or loss, nor should it be used for tax purposes.

## J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS LLC) Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition

The June 30, 2020, unaudited Statement of Financial Condition may now be viewed at http://investor.shareholder.com/jpmorganchase/financial-condition.cfm. If you would like us to send you a printed document at no cost, call us at 1.212.552.7202.

## J.P. Morgan Securities LLC Net Capital Requirements

JPMS LLC is subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule). As of July 31, 2020, JPMS LLC net capital of $27.5 billion exceeded the minimum regulatory net capital requirement of $5.5 billion by $22.0 billion.

## COMPENSATION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH MUTUAL FUND TRANSACTIONS

Advisors, distributors or other affiliates of certain mutual funds (which include money market and non-money market funds) may enter into arrangements to pay brokers that distribute their shares for administrative, technological or other services, including marketing and other support services provided to such funds or their affiliates. These fees, commonly referred to as "revenue sharing," are separate from, and in addition to, any shareholder servicing or distribution fees that a mutual fund pays out of its own assets pursuant to its Rule 12b-1 plan and other expenses which are described in a fund's prospectus fee table. Revenue sharing fees are paid out of the assets of the fund affiliate and not from the fund's assets and, therefore, have no impact on a fund's expense ratio or yield.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") receives compensation from fund families or their affiliates for providing certain administrative and clearing services. These payments are calculated either based on a percentage of the average dollar value of the fund assets held by JPMS in customer accounts or based on the number of mutual fund positions in the accounts. These fees may be paid from fund assets or may be subsidized in whole or in part by the advisor, distributor or other affiliates of the fund through revenue sharing. Revenue sharing payments are negotiated separately with each fund family and not all fund families pay the same amount or pay according to the same formula. There is, therefore, a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive to J.P. Morgan for making available to customer mutual funds whose affiliates enter into revenue sharing arrangements.

For the administrative and clearing services noted above, JPMS may receive revenue sharing payments of up to 0.50% per year or the average daily assets of fund shares carried in customer's accounts at JPMS and/or a rate of up to $21 per year per mutual fund position in each account, as applicable. To establish such arrangements with a fund company, JPMS has either entered into an agreement directly with the fund company or has entered into an agreement with a service provider which, in turn, has entered into an agreement directly with the fund company. Please note that the actual amount received by JPMS may be subject to periodic waiver by fund families and such waivers may reduce the actual amount received by JPMS. Funds whose affiliates do not make such revenue sharing payments to JPMS are generally not offered or recommended by JPMS, and in some cases, have higher returns or yields than funds whose affiliates do make revenue sharing payment. Compensation JPMS receives under these arrangements may be passed on to affiliates or non-affiliates of JPMS.

In addition to these payments, JPMS may receive additional revenue sharing payments from certain fund families. Most funds offered by JPMS make these additional revenue sharing payments based upon the percentage of a client's total purchase amount in one of these funds. Percentage payments to JPMS generally range from 0.08% to 0.25%. If, for example, a client invested $10,000 in a fund that paid 0.25%, the fund's advisor, distributor or other entity would pay JPMS $25. In addition, for any fund held in a client's account, and for as long as the client holds that fund, JPMS will receive an additional payment, paid quarterly, as a percentage per year of the amount held. Percentage payments generally range from 0.02% to 0.08%. For example, on a $10,000 holding, 0.08% is $8. Additionally, JPMS may receive an annual payment of up to $290,000. Lastly, JPMS may be reimbursed by or on behalf of mutual funds for expenses incurred for various sales meetings, seminars and conferences held in the normal course of business. Financial Advisors do not receive additional compensation from these revenue sharing payments made to JPMS.

The amounts listed above have been updated from those previously provided to you. The prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of mutual funds available through J.P. Morgan or your broker contain information regarding revenue sharing payments made by affiliates of the fund companies. In addition, information regarding revenue sharing can be found at www.Chase.com or related websites.

## INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is registered with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The MRSB provides investor information and educational documents online at msrb.org, including their "Information for Municipal Securities Investors" brochure, also referred to as their "Investor Brochure," which summarizes key principles of their rules that are designed to help protect investors who trade municipal securities. It also includes instructions on how to file a complaint against a registered brokerage firm or individuals associated with them.

## EXTENDED HOURS TRADING RISK DISCLOSURE

You should consider the following points before engaging in extended hours trading. "Extended hours trading" means trading outside of "regular trading hours." "Regular trading hours" generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours, or upon the opening the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.

Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING PURCHASES INDICATED AS AVERAGE PRICE

Your orders are processed in either (1) one execution at the confirmed price or (2) more than one execution, in which case the confirmed price is an average price. Please contact your J.P. Morgan representative for details regarding actual prices.

## FINRA BROKERCHECK PROGRAM

As part of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Program, BrokerCheck provides investors with the ability to research the professional backgrounds, business practices, and conduct of FINRA-registered brokerage firms and brokers. In connection with this program, investors may call the BrokerCheck Hotline at 800.289.9999, and visit the FINRA website at http://brokercheck.finra.org/. An investor brochure that includes information describing the FINRA BrokerCheck Program is available from either of these sources.

## PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW

JPMS may pay from time to time for certain order flow in the form of discounts, rebates, reductions of fees or credits. As a result of sending orders to certain trading centers, JPMS receives payment for order flow in the form of discounts, rebates, reductions of fees or credits. Under some circumstances, the amount of such remuneration may exceed the amount that JPMS is charged by such trading centers. This does not alter JPMS´ policy to route customer orders to the trading center where it believes clients will receive the best execution, taking into account price, reliability, market depth, quality of service, speed and efficiency. Additional details are available upon request.

## MARGIN ACCOUNT REMINDERS

If you own a margin account, we would like to remind you that:

Securities and other assets in your account are our collateral for any margin loan made to you. If the securities and other assets in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to maintain the required equity in your account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

- You can lose more funds than you deposit in your margin account. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can increase our "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Further, if you have a margin account with us, as permitted by law we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith. If you carry a margin balance, your account statement will reflect the current annual interest rate applicable to your margin loan. Please review the current rate, as under certain circumstances the rate may change without advance notice. If you have any questions or concerns about your current interest rate, please speak to your J.P. Morgan representative.

If you are a customer with a margin account, you have consented to our right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends, which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares. For additional information on pricing, please see the Market Prices paragraph above. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

This statement contains (i) information obtained from multiple direct, indirect, affiliated, unaffiliated, public and proprietary data sources (including, but not limited to identifying information, market data, calculated data, reference data, valuations, ratings, coupon and dividend rates and other fundamental data) and (ii) information which is calculated based upon such information (including but not limited to, market values, Current Yield and Estimated annual income). Although your Custodian believes these sources and the sources of market values are reliable, it does not independently review or verify such information and neither your Custodian nor any source will have any duty or obligation to verify, correct, complete, or update any such information. Such information is being provided to you with all faults for use entirely at your own risk; without any warranty whatsoever by your Custodian, its affiliates or any such source. Neither your Custodian or its affiliates nor any such source shall have any liability whatsoever relating to any inaccuracy or lack of timeliness or completeness of such information or any use thereof or for omissions therefrom nor for any lost profits, indirect, special or consequential damages. Moreover, such sources retain exclusive proprietary rights in such information. You may use such information only for your internal use and purposes and not for reuse (other than in connection with the transaction or position for which the information is provided) or retransmission without prior written approval of the source, or for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.

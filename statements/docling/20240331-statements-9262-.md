## Holdings

J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing

The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely for your convenience and may not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon. If you have questions related to the tax treatment of your investments, please consult your tax advisor. Unrealized gain/loss total reflects only those positions for which a cost basis is available or has been provided. J.P. Morgan has not, and cannot, validate the cost basis of positions reported by you or your agent, and are displayed solely for your convenience. Information on this statement related to cost and gain/loss calculations does not include adjustments for wash sales that may have occurred on transactions pending settlement. These wash sale adjustments, if any, will be reflected on your next statement.

For Mutual Funds, itemized cost basis displays each purchase, the aggregation of long term and short term investments, and/or the aggregation of long term and short term positions which origination cannot be determined, noted as 'Other'. For Mutual Funds, Market Value vs. Purchases is provided to assist you in comparing your total purchase, excluding reinvested distributions, with the current market value of the position. For Mutual Funds which you choose not to reinvest distributions, 'Cumulative Cash Distributions' is displayed to assist you in monitoring the position. This Cumulative Cash Distributions will only reflect cash distributions made after June 1, 2018. Investment Gain/Loss calculates the difference between your cost of Purchases from the current value of the fund, plus Cumulative Cash Distributions. In any Mutual Fund tax lot is noted 'Other' or cost basis is not available. Investment Gain/Loss will display 'Not Available.'

Investment Gain/Loss display is for informational purposes only as does not reflect your total unrealized gain or loss, nor should it be used for tax purposes.

## ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

Investments referred to as "Alternative Investments" include, but are not limited to, direct participation programs, private equity investments, pooled private investments (such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies), non-publically traded real estate investment trusts, private debt and hedge funds. While these investment types are each different, they do share some common characteristics such as: they are generally illiquid securities that are not listed on any exchange; there is a limited or no secondary trading market for these securities; and, there are typically restrictions on the timing and availability for redemptions. Additionally, private investment contracts, which would include most Alternative Investments, are ineligible for SIPC protection. Valuations of these investments are difficult to obtain and verify. The valuations of these investments presented on this statement have been obtained, unless otherwise noted, from the management, administrator or sponsor of each program (collectively, "Management"), or from a third-party vendor. These valuations have not been independently verified by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") and do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could be entered into or the actual terms on which existing transactions could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. Values are estimates only and may represent a value as of a date no greater than 18 months prior to the date of this statement. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation information is not available. In some instances, the valuations reflected on this statement may represent original cost, which information may or may not have been provided by Management or the third-party vendor. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please contact us if you wish to obtain additional or more specific information regarding the source(s) of the valuations. Alternative Investments may be reflected on your statement even though they may be held by a third party unaffiliated with JPMS. In such cases, unless JPMS otherwise agrees, JPMS has no responsibility for the verification, valuation, safekeeping or management of those assets.

In as much valuations may have been provided by Management of any program, you should review the operative documentation for each investment for the specific valuation methodology used by Management of that investment. JPMS expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the Management in deriving valuations; (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations; and, (3) any use to which the valuations are put.

In the case of Alternative Investments, the annual fair market valuations ("FMV") of your account assets are reported by JPMS based on the best information available to JPMS (or its vendor) as of December 31 of the reporting year. If a more accurate valuation is subsequently obtained, the information reported to the IRS may differ from that reported to you on the earlier date and the adjusted value may affect various calculations including, but not limited to, possible required minimum distributions ("RMD"). If you are subject to a RMD, JPMS may notify you of the adjusted value. Additionally, certain Alternative Investments (e.g., private equity funds) may require capital calls of their investors. If capital calls are required in connection with assets held by your retirement account, the funds to meet such calls must be paid from your retirement account. The preceding information should not be construed as tax or investment advice. Please consult your tax or investment advisor for questions concerning your tax or financial situation, including any questions regarding the effect of these characteristics of Alternative Investments. SPECIFIC NOTICE FOR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS:

: DPP or REIT securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, are generally illiquid and, even if a customer is able to sell the securities, the price received may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the account statement. Special Notice for DPP and REIT Securities

## LARGE TRADER REPORTING

A "large trader" is a legal entity or natural person who, directly or indirectly, through the exercise of investment discretion, effects transactions in the National Market System (NMS) securities that equal or exceed either:

- 20 million shares or $200 million over any calendar month. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- 2 million shares or $20 million during any calendar day; OR GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 13h-1 Large Trader Reporting System requires U.S. and non-U.S. market participants who meet the definition of large trader to:

- Promptly disclose to U.S. broker-dealers that execute trades or carry accounts for the large trader, their LTIDs and the accounts to which the LTIDs apply. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- File an electronic Form 13H with the SEC (via EDGAR) to obtain a large trader identification number (LTID); and GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

If you are a large trader and have completed a Form 13H, you will receive an LTID from the SEC. In order to ensure that LTID's are captured and reported as required under the SEC rule, you are required to promptly report your LTID to us and identify each account to which the LTID should be applied.

## EXTENDED HOURS TRADING RISK DISCLOSURE

You should consider the following points before engaging in extended hours trading. "Extended hours trading" means trading outside of "regular trading hours." "Regular trading hours" generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours, or upon the opening the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.

Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING PURCHASES INDICATED AS AVERAGE PRICE

Your orders are processed in either (1) one execution at the confirmed price or (2) more than one execution, in which case the confirmed price is an average price. Please contact your J.P. Morgan representative for details regarding actual prices.

## EDELIVERED TRADE CONFIRMATIONS

As a reminder, if you've elected to receive trade confirmations by electronic delivery, you can find current and past copies online in the Trade Confirmations section under Statements &amp; Documents. You can also find disclosures and important information about those trades, via a link on that page titled "See important disclosures for your confirmations".

## CUSTOMER FREE CREDIT BALANCES

For accounts that are held at JPMS, customer free credit balances may be used in this firm's business subject to the limitation of 17CFR Section 240.15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You have the right to receive from us in the course of normal business operation, upon demand, the delivery of:

- any fully-paid securities to which you are entitled GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- any free credit balances to which you are entitled GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- any securities purchased on margin upon full payment of any indebtedness to us GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

For clients enrolled in a sweep program, the balance in any bank deposit account or shares of any money market mutual fund in which you have a beneficial interest can be withdrawn or liquidated on your order and the proceeds returned to your securities account or remitted to you.

If this is a margin account and we maintain a special memorandum account for you, this is a combined statement of your general account and a special memorandum account maintained for you under Section 220.6 of Regulation T issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The permanent record of this separate account, as required by Regulation T, is available for your inspection.

Unless we hear from you to the contrary, it is our understanding that any free credit balances in your account are being maintained to facilitate your intention to invest such amounts through us.

## MARGIN ACCOUNT REMINDERS

If you own a margin account, we would like to remind you that:

Securities and other assets in your account are our collateral for any margin loan made to you. If the securities and other assets in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to maintain the required equity in your account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

- You can lose more funds than you deposit in your margin account. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can increase our "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Further, if you have a margin account with us, as permitted by law we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith. If you carry a margin balance, your account statement will reflect the current annual interest rate applicable to your margin loan. Please review the current rate, as under certain circumstances the rate may change without advance notice. If you have any questions or concerns about your current interest rate, please speak to your J.P. Morgan representative.

If you are a customer with a margin account, you have consented to our right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends, which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENTS

Automatic Reinvestment transactions excluding those conducted by DTC or in open ended mutual funds are processed by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) on an agency basis.

JPMS provides you with the ability to enroll in a program to re-invest any and all dividend, capital gains and return of capital distributions (collectively "Distributions") for securities eligible for participation (the Program). By participating in the Program, all dividends and capital gains distributions paid on eligible accounts or individual securities you have selected will automatically be reinvested into the shares of the same security. The important terms of the Program include:

- Voluntary Participation. Participation in the Program is voluntary and you may modify or discontinue your participation at any time. You may enroll by specifying individual securities or have all eligible securities in your account participate in the Program; modify your elections; or unenroll from the Program through the website or by contacting your PCA or FA. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Trade Execution. With the exception of open ended mutual funds, provided you are enrolled in the Program prior to the record date, JPMS reinvests the Distributions from an eligible security on the pay date of the Distribution, at an average weighted price. For certain securities, reinvestment may occur through the Depository Trust Company (DTC), which may be later than the pay date. There may be a difference in price depending on the whether the Program trade is made through J.P. Morgan or DTC. These transactions will post to your account when the shares are made available to JPMS by DTC and will be reflected on your statement. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- No Fees. No commission or fee are charged for Program trades. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Fractional Shares. JPMS will credit to your account the number of shares equal to the amount of your funds to be reinvested in a particular security divided by the purchase price per share. If made available for your account, participation in the Program may give you interests in fractional shares of securities, which JPMS calculates to five decimal places. You will receive dividend payments proportionate to your partial share holdings. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Confirmation of Transactions. All Program trades will be reflected on monthly account statements. You will not receive separate immediate confirmations for Program trades. You may request the details of any Program trade by contacting JPMS. Transactions that are not part of the Program will continue to receive confirmations contemporaneously with the trade. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- No Recommendation. The inclusion of any security in the Program is not a recommendation by JPMS to buy, hold or sell such security. Participation in the Program does not assure profits on your investments and does not protect against loss in declining markets. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Eligibility. Generally, all brokerage accounts are eligible for participation as are most equities, open ended mutual funds, closed end funds and ETFs. Any exclusions will be identified at the time you are enrolled. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Program Changes. Program participants will be notified in advance if there are any material changes to the Program though no notice may be given if there are changes to the eligibility of any particular security. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

## IMPORTANT UPDATES TO STRUCTURED PRODUCTS

Structured products, including market linked CDs, are marked to market (or priced) on a daily basis. Prices may fluctuate and these investments may be worth less or more than the initial purchase price at maturity. There is no guarantee that a secondary market will exist.

## UPDATES TO THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNT AGREEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES BOOKLET - REMINDER

Reminder, in December 2023, we made the following updates to our Investment Account Agreements and Disclosures Booklet ("Booklet"). If you have questions, please contact your J.P. Morgan Advisor or call us at the number on the front of your statement. To access a current version of the Booklet, go to chase.com/content/dam/chase-ux/documents/personal/investments/jpm-investment-account-agreements.pdf.

The Investment Advisory Agreement ("Advisory Agreement") was updated:

-  In Section 3.D. "J.P. Morgan Personal Advisors Program" a new discretionary Tax Harvesting program feature was added.
-  In Section 5.D "Tax Harvesting" language clarifying discretion and program availability was added.

## SHORTENED SETTLEMENT CYCLE BRINGS INVESTOR BENEFITS

On May 28, many U.S. security settlement cycles are transitioning from a two-day cycle (T+2) to a more efficient one-day cycle (T+1).

Accelerating the settlement cycle allows for a more streamlined and agile market and smoother trade executions, with benefits such as:

-  Greater flexibility in your portfolio as you can buy and sell eligible securities faster
-  50% quicker access to payments from the sale of eligible securities
-  More secure transactions with minimized exposure to counterparty and market risk

## What you need to know

-  Securities moving to the new T+1 settlement cycle include corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, rights, warrants settling at the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC), and non-agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) bonds.
-  Securities not impacted by U.S. T+1 include: firm commitment equity and debt offerings, U.S. government-issued securities, mutual funds, and security-based swaps.
-  Spot foreign exchange transactions in most currency pairs will remain at two-day processing. If you conduct U.S. securities transactions that require currency conversion, please review how you will fund the transaction with one-day processing to avoid settlement failures.

To ensure your transactions are covered to avoid overdrafts and trade failures once the T+1 settlement cycle takes effect on May 28, you will need to:

-  Make funds available one day earlier if you are purchasing securities
-  Have securities available (in good deliverable form) one day earlier if you are selling securities
-  Submit all allocations to J.P. Morgan by 7 p.m. Eastern Time on the trade date

We're here to help

- Visit https://www.chase.com/personal/investments/personal-advisors for more information.

PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS

-  We added a section "D. Foreign Exchange" and added the following: Description:
- A foreign exchange spot transaction involves two parties agreeing to exchange currency at the exchange rate at the time of trade, or "on the spot." A foreign exchange spot transaction is normally settled within two days.

Fees:

Forward and spot transactions in foreign exchange are executed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and are subject to a mark-up (if you are the buyer) or mark-down (if you are the seller) of up to 2.00% of the notional amount per transaction.

## Risks and other relevant information:

Foreign currencies or baskets of currencies may be very volatile and may experience significant drops in value over a short period of time. The value of a foreign currency will depend on, among other economic indicators, movements in exchange rates. Risks and special considerations with respect to foreign currencies include, but are not limited to, economic uncertainties, currency devaluations, political and social uncertainties, exchange control regulations, high rates of interest, a history of government and private sector defaults, significant government influence on the economy, less rigorous regulatory and accounting standards than in the United States, relatively less developed financial and other systems and limited liquidity and higher price volatility of the related securities markets. Your advisor may not recommend the purchase of, or investment in, foreign currencies in full-service brokerage retirement accounts.

With respect to security positions received into your account, cost basis information, if any, has been provided by you.  Further information is available upon request.

You may hold positions where the original cost basis has been adjusted to reflect amortization or accretion.

For Regulated Investment Companies or Dividend Reinvestment Plan sales, for which the average price method has been chosen, positions are closed out on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis.

Such information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with your records and your tax advisor.

Dividends credited to your account may include capital gains, non-taxable dividends and/or dividends on foreign stock. You may wish to consult your tax advisor with regard to your tax liability on these dividends. DIVIDEND INCOME:

For balances other than sweep program balances, is calculated by dividing EAI by the market value of the security. You should also know that: (i) the figures shown in this statement are estimates based on mathematical calculations using data obtained from outside sources; they are provided for informational purposes only, and are not a projection or guarantee of future returns. (ii) because prices of securities, coupon and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, these estimates should not be relied upon exclusively for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. (iii) because different asset types (e.g., equities versus fixed income securities) tend to have different investment characteristics, these estimates should not be compared across asset types; (iv) EAI and EY for certain types of securities might include return of principal or capital gains, in which case the EAI and EY would be overstated. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAI or EY presented, and your actual income and yield might be higher or lower.

ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online.

Important Information should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price column on your statement will indicate unpriced. A description of J.P.

Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various issuers of the securities, affiliates or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use.  Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. VALUATIONS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS:

When we are unable to obtain a current value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate Unpriced. Although such securities may have value, please note that the value of a security indicated as Unpriced will not be included in your overall current market value as reflected on the statement. UNPRICED SECURITIES:

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares. For additional information on pricing, please see the Market Prices paragraph above. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

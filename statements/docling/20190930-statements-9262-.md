These compensation payments, if made, will not increase your account fees.

## MARGIN ACCOUNTS

Securities and other assets in your account are the firm's collateral for any margin loan made to you. If the securities and other assets in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, the firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the member, in order to maintain the required equity in the account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

- The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- The firm can increase its "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Further, if you have a margin account with us, as permitted by law we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith.

## LARGE TRADE REPORTING

## COMPENSATION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH MUTUAL FUND TRANSACTIONS

Advisors, distributors or other affiliates of certain mutual funds (which include money market and non-money market funds) may enter into arrangements to pay brokers that distribute their shares for administrative, technological or other services, including marketing and other support services provided to such funds or their affiliates. These fees, commonly referred to as "revenue sharing," are separate from, and in addition to, any shareholder servicing or distribution fees that a mutual fund pays out of its own assets pursuant to its Rule 12b-1 plan and other expenses which are described in a fund's prospectus fee table. Revenue sharing fees are paid out of the assets of the fund affiliate and not from the fund's assets and, therefore, have no impact on a fund's expense ratio or yield.

- J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") receives compensation from fund families or their affiliates for providing certain administrative and clearing services. These payments are calculated either based on a percentage of the average dollar value of the fund assets held by JPMS in customer accounts or based on the number of mutual fund positions in the accounts. These fees may be paid from fund assets or may be subsidized in whole or in part by the advisor, distributor or other affiliates of the fund through revenue sharing. Revenue sharing payments are negotiated separately with each fund family and not all fund families pay the same amount or pay according to the same formula. There is, therefore, a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive to J.P. Morgan for making available to customer mutual funds whose affiliates enter into revenue sharing arrangements.

For the administrative and clearing services noted above, JPMS may receive revenue sharing payments of up to 0.50% per year or the average daily assets of fund shares carried in customer's accounts at JPMS and/or a rate of up to $21 per year per mutual fund position in each account, as applicable. To establish such arrangements with a fund company, JPMS has either entered into an agreement directly with the fund company or has entered into an agreement with a service provider which, in turn, has entered into an agreement directly with the fund company. Please note that the actual amount received by JPMS may be subject to periodic waiver by fund families and such waivers may reduce the actual amount received by JPMS. Funds whose affiliates do not make such revenue sharing payments to JPMS are generally not offered or recommended by JPMS, and in some cases, have higher returns or yields than funds whose affiliates do make revenue sharing payment. Compensation JPMS receives under these arrangements may be passed on to affiliates or non-affiliates of JPMS.

In addition to these payments, JPMS may receive additional revenue sharing payments from certain fund families. Most funds offered by JPMS make these additional revenue sharing payments based upon the percentage of a client's total purchase amount in one of these funds. Percentage payments to JPMS generally range from 0.08% to 0.25%. If, for example, a client invested $10,000 in a fund that paid 0.25%, the fund's advisor, distributor or other entity would pay JPMS $25. In addition, for any fund held in a client's account, and for as long as the client holds that fund, JPMS will receive an additional payment, paid quarterly, as a percentage per year of the amount held. Percentage payments generally range from 0.02% to 0.08%. For example, on a $10,000 holding, 0.08% is $8. Additionally, JPMS may receive an annual payment of up to $290,000. Lastly, JPMS may be reimbursed by or on behalf of mutual funds for expenses incurred for various sales meetings, seminars and conferences held in the normal course of business. Financial Advisors do not receive additional compensation from these revenue sharing payments made to JPMS.

The amounts listed above have been updated from those previously provided to you. The prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of mutual funds available through J.P. Morgan or your broker contain information regarding revenue sharing payments made by affiliates of the fund companies. In addition, information regarding revenue sharing can be found at www.Chase.com or related websites.

## MARGIN ACCOUNT

If you are a customer with a margin account, you consent to JP Morgan's right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

## EXTENDED HOURS TRADING RISK DISCLOSURE

You should consider the following points before engaging in extended hours trading. "Extended hours trading" means trading outside of "regular trading hours." "Regular trading hours" generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours, or upon the opening the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.

Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

## FINRA BROKERCHECK PROGRAM

As part of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Program, BrokerCheck provides investors with the ability to research the professional backgrounds, business practices, and conduct of FINRA-registered brokerage firms and brokers. In connection with this program, investors may call the BrokerCheck Hotline at 800.289.9999, and visit the FINRA website at http://brokercheck.finra.org/. An investor brochure that includes information describing the FINRA BrokerCheck Program is available from either of these sources.

## PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW

JPMS may pay from time to time for certain order flow in the form of discounts, rebates, reductions of fees or credits. As a result of sending orders to certain trading centers, JPMS receives payment for order flow in the form of discounts, rebates, reductions of fees or credits. Under some circumstances, the amount of such remuneration may exceed the amount that JPMS is charged by such trading centers. This does not alter JPMS´ policy to route customer orders to the trading center where it believes clients will receive the best execution, taking into account price, reliability, market depth, quality of service, speed and efficiency. Additional details are available upon request.

## NOTICE OF ESCHEATMENT PROCESS FOR UNCLAIMED PROPERTY

Under state law, if no account activity occurs within your investment account for a period of years (as defined by your state) or if your account statement is returned to us as undeliverable, your account will be considered inactive. If this occurs, we will notify you of the action you need to take to reactivate your account. If you do not take action as requested, your account may be deemed "unclaimed" or "abandoned." This starts a process called escheatment in which we are required to transfer your account to your last known state of residence. If your account is escheated, you will have to work with your state to get your assets back. To avoid escheatment, please ensure that your account remains active and that your contact information is up-to-date.

Pricing estimates may be based on bids, prices within the bid offer spread, closing prices or matrix methodology that uses data relating to other securities whose prices are more ascertainable to produce a hypothetical price based on the estimated yield spread relationship between the securities. Pricing estimates do not constitute bids for any securities. Actual prices realized at sale may be more or less than those shown on your statement.

STATEMENT SUMMARY

from its purchase price. Accurate valuation information is not available. The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely as a general indication of performance and should not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon without the assistance of your tax advisor. With respect to security positions received into your account, cost basis information, if any, has been provided by you.  Further information is available upon request.

You may hold positions where the original cost basis has been adjusted to reflect amortization or accretion.

For Regulated Investment Companies or Dividend Reinvestment Plan sales, for which the average price method has been chosen, positions are closed out on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis.

These statements are not official documents for income tax reporting purposes and should not be relied upon for such purposes, including determination of income, cost basis, amortization or accretion, or gain/loss. Such information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with your records and your tax advisor.

Dividends credited to your account may include capital gains, non-taxable dividends and/or dividends on foreign stock. You may wish to consult your tax advisor with regard to your tax liability on these dividends. DIVIDEND INCOME:

Estimated Annual Income (EAI) is calculated by multiplying either the current coupon rate or an estimated annual dividend (generally calculated by annualizing the most recent regular cash dividend) by the quantity of the security held. For balances other than sweep program balances, Estimated Yield (EY) is calculated by dividing EAI by the market value of the security. These figures are estimates based on mathematical calculations using data obtained from outside sources. Because prices of securities, coupon and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, these estimates should not be relied upon exclusively for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. Because different asset types (e.g. equities versus fixed income securities) tend to have different investment characteristics, these estimates should not be compared across asset types. These calculations are for informational purposes only and are not a projection or guarantee of future returns. Additionally, please note that EAI and EY for certain types of Securities might include Return of Principal or Capital Gains in which case the EAI and EY would be overstated. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate EAI or EY presented. Actual income and yield might be higher or lower. Please contact us for additional information. ESTIMATED ANNUAL INCOME AND ESTIMATED YIELD:

ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online. Accordingly, investors should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price column on your statement will indicate unpriced. A description of J.P. Morgans practices and procedures regarding ARS is available at www.jpmorgan.com/muniars. IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS):

Valuations of VALUATIONS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS:

Page  14 of 16

Important Information over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various issuers of the securities, affiliates or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use.  Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction.

When we are unable to obtain a current value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate Unpriced. Although such securities may have value, please note that the value of a security indicated as Unpriced will not be included in your overall current market value as reflected on the statement. UNPRICED SECURITIES:

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares. For additional information on pricing, please see the Market Prices paragraph above. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

This statement contains (i) information obtained from multiple direct, indirect, affiliated, unaffiliated, public and proprietary data sources (including, but not limited to identifying information, market data, calculated data, reference data, valuations, ratings, coupon and dividend rates and other fundamental data) and (ii) information which is calculated based upon such information (including but not limited to, market values, Current Yield and Estimated annual income). Although your Custodian believes these sources and the sources of market values are reliable, it does not independently review or verify such information and neither your Custodian nor any source will have any duty or obligation to verify, correct, complete, or update any such information. Such information is being provided to you with all faults for use entirely at your own risk; without any warranty whatsoever by your Custodian, its affiliates or any such source. Neither your Custodian or its affiliates nor any such source shall have any liability whatsoever relating to any inaccuracy or lack of timeliness or completeness of such information or any use thereof or for omissions therefrom nor for any lost profits, indirect, special or consequential damages. Moreover, such sources retain exclusive proprietary rights in such information. You may use such information only for your internal use and purposes and not for reuse (other than in connection with the transaction or position for which the information is provided) or retransmission without prior written approval of the source, or for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.

## Holdings

J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing

The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely for your convenience and may not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon. If you have questions related to the tax treatment of your investments, please consult your tax advisor. Unrealized gain/loss total reflects only those positions for which a cost basis is available or has been provided. J.P. Morgan has not, and cannot, validate the cost basis of positions reported by you or your agent, and are displayed solely for your convenience. Information on this statement related to cost and gain/loss calculations does not include adjustments for wash sales that may have occurred on transactions pending settlement. These wash sale adjustments, if any, will be reflected on your next statement.

For Mutual Funds, itemized cost basis displays each purchase, the aggregation of long term and short term investments, and/or the aggregation of long term and short term positions which origination cannot be determined, noted as 'Other'. For Mutual Funds, Market Value vs. Purchases is provided to assist you in comparing your total purchase, excluding reinvested distributions, with the current market value of the position. For Mutual Funds which you choose not to reinvest distributions, 'Cumulative Cash Distributions' is displayed to assist you in monitoring the position. This Cumulative Cash Distributions will only reflect cash distributions made after June 1, 2018. Investment Gain/Loss calculates the difference between your cost of Purchases from the current value of the fund, plus Cumulative Cash Distributions. In any Mutual Fund tax lot is noted 'Other' or cost basis is not available. Investment Gain/Loss will display 'Not Available.'

Investment Gain/Loss display is for informational purposes only as does not reflect your total unrealized gain or loss, nor should it be used for tax purposes.

## ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

Investments referred to as "Alternative Investments" include, but are not limited to, direct participation programs, private equity investments, pooled private investments (such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies), non-publically traded real estate investment trusts, private debt and hedge funds. While these investment types are each different, they do share some common characteristics such as: they are generally illiquid securities that are not listed on any exchange; there is a limited or no secondary trading market for these securities; and, there are typically restrictions on the timing and availability for redemptions. Additionally, private investment contracts, which would include most Alternative Investments, are ineligible for SIPC protection. Valuations of these investments are difficult to obtain and verify. The valuations of these investments presented on this statement have been obtained, unless otherwise noted, from the management, administrator or sponsor of each program (collectively, "Management"), or from a third-party vendor. These valuations have not been independently verified by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") and do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could be entered into or the actual terms on which existing transactions could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. Values are estimates only and may represent a value as of a date no greater than 18 months prior to the date of this statement. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation information is not available. In some instances, the valuations reflected on this statement may represent original cost, which information may or may not have been provided by Management or the third-party vendor. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please contact us if you wish to obtain additional or more specific information regarding the source(s) of the valuations. Alternative Investments may be reflected on your statement even though they may be held by a third party unaffiliated with JPMS. In such cases, unless JPMS otherwise agrees, JPMS has no responsibility for the verification, valuation, safekeeping or management of those assets.

In as much valuations may have been provided by Management of any program, you should review the operative documentation for each investment for the specific valuation methodology used by Management of that investment. JPMS expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the Management in deriving valuations; (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations; and, (3) any use to which the valuations are put.

In the case of Alternative Investments, the annual fair market valuations ("FMV") of your account assets are reported by JPMS based on the best information available to JPMS (or its vendor) as of December 31 of the reporting year. If a more accurate valuation is subsequently obtained, the information reported to the IRS may differ from that reported to you on the earlier date and the adjusted value may affect various calculations including, but not limited to, possible required minimum distributions ("RMD"). If you are subject to a RMD, JPMS may notify you of the adjusted value. Additionally, certain Alternative Investments (e.g., private equity funds) may require capital calls of their investors. If capital calls are required in connection with assets held by your retirement account, the funds to meet such calls must be paid from your retirement account. The preceding information should not be construed as tax or investment advice. Please consult your tax or investment advisor for questions concerning your tax or financial situation, including any questions regarding the effect of these characteristics of Alternative Investments. SPECIFIC NOTICE FOR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS:

: DPP or REIT securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, are generally illiquid and, even if a customer is able to sell the securities, the price received may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the account statement. Special Notice for DPP and REIT Securities

## ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER NOTICE

In case of errors or questions about electronic fund transfers to/from your account (via the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network), your account statement or transaction record, please call us immediately at 1-800-392-5749 or write to us at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, PO Box 1762, Mail Code: IL1-0291, Chicago, IL 60690-1762.

## Please provide the following information:

1. Your name and account number,
2. The dollar amount of the suspected error, and
3. A description of the error or the transfer you are unsure about; please explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.

Please note: We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the first account statement on which the problem or error appeared. If you tell us verbally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question; for errors involving new accounts or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate.

We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

## MARGIN ACCOUNT REMINDERS

If you own a margin account, we would like to remind you that:

Securities and other assets in your account are our collateral for any margin loan made to you. If the securities and other assets in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to maintain the required equity in your account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

- You can lose more funds than you deposit in your margin account. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can increase our "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Further, if you have a margin account with us, as permitted by law we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith. If you carry a margin balance, your account statement will reflect the current annual interest rate applicable to your margin loan. Please review the current rate, as under certain circumstances the rate may change without advance notice. If you have any questions or concerns about your current interest rate, please speak to your J.P. Morgan representative.

If you are a customer with a margin account, you have consented to our right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends, which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENTS

Automatic Reinvestment transactions excluding those conducted by DTC or in open ended mutual funds are processed by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) on an agency basis.

JPMS provides you with the ability to enroll in a program to re-invest any and all dividend, capital gains and return of capital distributions (collectively "Distributions") for securities eligible for participation (the Program). By participating in the Program, all dividends and capital gains distributions paid on eligible accounts or individual securities you have selected will automatically be reinvested into the shares of the same security. The important terms of the Program include:

- Voluntary Participation. Participation in the Program is voluntary and you may modify or discontinue your participation at any time. You may enroll by specifying individual securities or have all eligible securities in your account participate in the Program; modify your elections; or unenroll from the Program through the website or by contacting your PCA or FA. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Trade Execution. With the exception of open ended mutual funds, provided you are enrolled in the Program prior to the record date, JPMS reinvests the Distributions from an eligible security on the pay date of the Distribution, at an average weighted price. For certain securities, reinvestment may occur through the Depository Trust Company (DTC), which may be later than the pay date. There may be a difference in price depending on the whether the Program trade is made through J.P. Morgan or DTC. These transactions will post to your account when the shares are made available to JPMS by DTC and will be reflected on your statement. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- No Fees. No commission or fee are charged for Program trades. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Fractional Shares. JPMS will credit to your account the number of shares equal to the amount of your funds to be reinvested in a particular security divided by the purchase price per share. If made available for your account, participation in the Program may give you interests in fractional shares of securities, which JPMS calculates to five decimal places. You will receive dividend payments proportionate to your partial share holdings. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Confirmation of Transactions. All Program trades will be reflected on monthly account statements. You will not receive separate immediate confirmations for Program trades. You may request the details of any Program trade by contacting JPMS. Transactions that are not part of the Program will continue to receive confirmations contemporaneously with the trade. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- No Recommendation. The inclusion of any security in the Program is not a recommendation by JPMS to buy, hold or sell such security. Participation in the Program does not assure profits on your investments and does not protect against loss in declining markets. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Eligibility. Generally, all brokerage accounts are eligible for participation as are most equities, open ended mutual funds, closed end funds and ETFs. Any exclusions will be identified at the time you are enrolled. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Program Changes. Program participants will be notified in advance if there are any material changes to the Program though no notice may be given if there are changes to the eligibility of any particular security. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

## IMPORTANT UPDATES TO STRUCTURED PRODUCTS

Structured products, including market linked CDs, are marked to market (or priced) on a daily basis. Prices may fluctuate and these investments may be worth less or more than the initial purchase price at maturity. There is no guarantee that a secondary market will exist.

## AN UPDATE TO THE SEC SECTION 31 TRANSACTION FEE

All exchange-listed equity and option sales are subject to a Section 31 transaction fee, which is set by the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC). This fee is shown on trade confirmations.

Effective May 22, 2024, the SEC increased the rate of this fee from $0.000008 to $0.0002780. This fee is calculated by multiplying the principal amount of trade by the new rate.

## UPDATES TO THE GUIDE TO INVESTMENT SERVICES AND BROKERAGE PRODUCTS

We have updated our Guide to Investment Services and Brokerage Products (the "Guide") and the following is a summary of the those updates. To learn more, please review the current version of the Guide at jpmorganinvestment.com.

Investment Accounts &amp; Services

Under "A. Different Types of Investment Accounts," in "Brokerage Accounts," we replaced existing language with revised language stating our fiduciary obligations when we make investment recommendations to you for your qualified retirement plan account or IRA. When we provide such fiduciary investment recommendations, we are required under a special rule to, among other things, act in your best interest and not put our interest ahead of yours.

However, there are situations where we are not considered a fiduciary under this special rule, such as when we merely provide general investment information and education, or when you take an action not based on our recommendation.

If you have questions about these updates, please contact your J.P. Morgan Advisor or contact us at the number on the front of your statement.

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares.

## Holdings

J.P. Morgan Self-Directed Investing

The total cost basis for each security position and the unrealized gain/loss are provided solely for your convenience and may not be used for tax purposes or otherwise relied upon. If you have questions related to the tax treatment of your investments, please consult your tax advisor. Unrealized gain/loss total reflects only those positions for which a cost basis is available or has been provided. J.P. Morgan has not, and cannot, validate the cost basis of positions reported by you or your agent, and are displayed solely for your convenience. Information on this statement related to cost and gain/loss calculations does not include adjustments for wash sales that may have occurred on transactions pending settlement. These wash sale adjustments, if any, will be reflected on your next statement.

For Mutual Funds, itemized cost basis displays each purchase, the aggregation of long term and short term investments, and/or the aggregation of long term and short term positions which origination cannot be determined, noted as 'Other'. For Mutual Funds, Market Value vs. Purchases is provided to assist you in comparing your total purchase, excluding reinvested distributions, with the current market value of the position. For Mutual Funds which you choose not to reinvest distributions, 'Cumulative Cash Distributions' is displayed to assist you in monitoring the position. This Cumulative Cash Distributions will only reflect cash distributions made after June 1, 2018. Investment Gain/Loss calculates the difference between your cost of Purchases from the current value of the fund, plus Cumulative Cash Distributions. In any Mutual Fund tax lot is noted 'Other' or cost basis is not available. Investment Gain/Loss will display 'Not Available.'

Investment Gain/Loss display is for informational purposes only as does not reflect your total unrealized gain or loss, nor should it be used for tax purposes.

## ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

Investments referred to as "Alternative Investments" include, but are not limited to, direct participation programs, private equity investments, pooled private investments (such as limited partnerships and limited liability companies), non-publically traded real estate investment trusts, private debt and hedge funds. While these investment types are each different, they do share some common characteristics such as: they are generally illiquid securities that are not listed on any exchange; there is a limited or no secondary trading market for these securities; and, there are typically restrictions on the timing and availability for redemptions. Additionally, private investment contracts, which would include most Alternative Investments, are ineligible for SIPC protection. Valuations of these investments are difficult to obtain and verify. The valuations of these investments presented on this statement have been obtained, unless otherwise noted, from the management, administrator or sponsor of each program (collectively, "Management"), or from a third-party vendor. These valuations have not been independently verified by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") and do not represent the actual terms at which transactions or securities could be bought or sold or new transactions could be entered into or the actual terms on which existing transactions could be liquidated as of the date of this statement. Values are estimates only and may represent a value as of a date no greater than 18 months prior to the date of this statement. If an estimated value is not provided, valuation information is not available. In some instances, the valuations reflected on this statement may represent original cost, which information may or may not have been provided by Management or the third-party vendor. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use. Please contact us if you wish to obtain additional or more specific information regarding the source(s) of the valuations. Alternative Investments may be reflected on your statement even though they may be held by a third party unaffiliated with JPMS. In such cases, unless JPMS otherwise agrees, JPMS has no responsibility for the verification, valuation, safekeeping or management of those assets.

In as much valuations may have been provided by Management of any program, you should review the operative documentation for each investment for the specific valuation methodology used by Management of that investment. JPMS expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the information and the methodology used by the Management in deriving valuations; (2) any errors or omissions in compiling or disseminating the valuations; and, (3) any use to which the valuations are put.

In the case of Alternative Investments, the annual fair market valuations ("FMV") of your account assets are reported by JPMS based on the best information available to JPMS (or its vendor) as of December 31 of the reporting year. If a more accurate valuation is subsequently obtained, the information reported to the IRS may differ from that reported to you on the earlier date and the adjusted value may affect various calculations including, but not limited to, possible required minimum distributions ("RMD"). If you are subject to a RMD, JPMS may notify you of the adjusted value. Additionally, certain Alternative Investments (e.g., private equity funds) may require capital calls of their investors. If capital calls are required in connection with assets held by your retirement account, the funds to meet such calls must be paid from your retirement account. The preceding information should not be construed as tax or investment advice. Please consult your tax or investment advisor for questions concerning your tax or financial situation, including any questions regarding the effect of these characteristics of Alternative Investments. SPECIFIC NOTICE FOR RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS:

: DPP or REIT securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, are generally illiquid and, even if a customer is able to sell the securities, the price received may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the account statement. Special Notice for DPP and REIT Securities

## ANNUAL ACCOUNT FEE REMINDER

Certain investment accounts are subject to a $50 annual fee. This fee does not apply to:

- Accounts opened in 2022 GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Clients with $25,000 or more in combined investment balances GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Accounts that had at least one commissionable trade in the calendar year GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Clients with $50,000 or more in linked checking/savings balances GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Self-Directed Investing accounts GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Retirement Accounts GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Custodial Accounts GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- Managed Accounts GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Unless your account meets at least one of these or other waiver criteria by December 31, 2022, the fee will be charged to your account in January 2023. Please make sure that your account has enough cash or cash equivalents, like money market funds, to cover the fee.

## COMPENSATION RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH MUTUAL FUND TRANSACTIONS

Advisors, distributors or other affiliates of certain mutual funds (which include money market and non-money market funds) may enter into arrangements to pay brokers that distribute their shares for administrative, technological or other services, including marketing and other support services provided to such funds or their affiliates. These fees, commonly referred to as "revenue sharing," are separate from, and in addition to, any shareholder servicing or distribution fees that a mutual fund pays out of its own assets pursuant to its Rule 12b-1 plan and other expenses which are described in a fund's prospectus fee table. Revenue sharing fees are paid out of the assets of the fund affiliate and not from the fund's assets and, therefore, have no impact on a fund's expense ratio or yield.

- J.P. Morgan Securities LLC ("JPMS") receives compensation from fund families or their affiliates for providing certain administrative and clearing services. These payments are calculated either based on a percentage of the average dollar value of the fund assets held by JPMS in customer accounts or based on the number of mutual fund positions in the accounts. These fees may be paid from fund assets or may be subsidized in whole or in part by the advisor, distributor or other affiliates of the fund through revenue sharing. Revenue sharing payments are negotiated separately with each fund family and not all fund families pay the same amount or pay according to the same formula. There is, therefore, a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial incentive to J.P. Morgan for making available to customer mutual funds whose affiliates enter into revenue sharing arrangements.

For the administrative and clearing services noted above, JPMS may receive revenue sharing payments of up to 0.50% per year or the average daily assets of fund shares carried in customer's accounts at JPMS and/or a rate of up to $21 per year per mutual fund position in each account, as applicable. To establish such arrangements with a fund company, JPMS has either entered into an agreement directly with the fund company or has entered into an agreement with a service provider which, in turn, has entered into an agreement directly with the fund company. Please note that the actual amount received by JPMS may be subject to periodic waiver by fund families and such waivers may reduce the actual amount received by JPMS. Funds whose affiliates do not make such revenue sharing payments to JPMS are generally not offered or recommended by JPMS, and in some cases, have higher returns or yields than funds whose affiliates do make revenue sharing payment. Compensation JPMS receives under these arrangements may be passed on to affiliates or non-affiliates of JPMS.

In addition to these payments, JPMS may receive additional revenue sharing payments from certain fund families. Most funds offered by JPMS make these additional revenue sharing payments based upon the percentage of a client's total purchase amount in one of these funds. Percentage payments to JPMS generally range from 0.08% to 0.25%. If, for example, a client invested $10,000 in a fund that paid 0.25%, the fund's advisor, distributor or other entity would pay JPMS $25. In addition, for any fund held in a client's account, and for as long as the client holds that fund, JPMS will receive an additional payment, paid quarterly, as a percentage per year of the amount held. Percentage payments generally range from 0.02% to 0.08%. For example, on a $10,000 holding, 0.08% is $8. Additionally, JPMS may receive an annual payment of up to $290,000. Lastly, JPMS may be reimbursed by or on behalf of mutual funds for expenses incurred for various sales meetings, seminars and conferences held in the normal course of business. Financial Advisors do not receive additional compensation from these revenue sharing payments made to JPMS.

The amounts listed above have been updated from those previously provided to you. The prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of mutual funds available through J.P. Morgan or your broker contain information regarding revenue sharing payments made by affiliates of the fund companies. In addition, information regarding revenue sharing can be found at www.Chase.com or related websites.

## EXTENDED HOURS TRADING RISK DISCLOSURE

You should consider the following points before engaging in extended hours trading. "Extended hours trading" means trading outside of "regular trading hours." "Regular trading hours" generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity. Liquidity is important because with greater liquidity it is easier for investors to buy or sell securities, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular market hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either at the end of regular market hours, or upon the opening the next morning. As a result, you may receive an inferior price in extended hours trading than you would during regular market hours.

Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securities. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you would in another extended hours trading system.

Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announcements may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading may result in wider than normal spreads for a particular security.

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING PURCHASES INDICATED AS AVERAGE PRICE

Your orders are processed in either (1) one execution at the confirmed price or (2) more than one execution, in which case the confirmed price is an average price. Please contact your J.P. Morgan representative for details regarding actual prices.

## FINRA BROKERCHECK PROGRAM

As part of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Investor Education Program, BrokerCheck provides investors with the ability to research the professional backgrounds, business practices, and conduct of FINRA-registered brokerage firms and brokers. In connection with this program, investors may call the BrokerCheck Hotline at 800.289.9999, and visit the FINRA website at http://brokercheck.finra.org/. An investor brochure that includes information describing the FINRA BrokerCheck Program is available from either of these sources.

## PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW

JPMS does not receive payment for order flow from market makers for customer orders in equity securities. JPMS receives rebates from and pays fees to some registered securities exchanges for providing or taking liquidity on those exchanges, according to those exchanges' published fee schedules approved by the SEC. Alternative trading systems also charge fees and, in some cases, pay rebates for the provision or removal of liquidity. In addition, JPMS receives marketing fees from options exchanges under marketing fee programs sponsored by some exchanges. Under some circumstances, the amount received by JPMS from a trading center over a period of time may exceed the amount that JPMS is charged by a trading center. These practices are one of many factors that may impact routing decisions and do not alter JPMS' policy to route customer orders in securities to the trading centers where it believes customers will receive the best execution, taking into account, among other factors, price, transaction cost, volatility, reliability, market depth, and speed.

Affiliates of JPMS have ownership interests in some trading centers. Accordingly, JPMS stands to share in any profits that these trading centers earn from the execution of JPMS customer orders on those trading centers. Additional information on the material aspects of JPMS' relationships with the primary trading centers to which JPMS routes, including descriptions of arrangements for payment for order flow and profit-sharing relationships, is available in JPMS' SEC Rule 606 reports at https://www.jpmorgan.com/disclosures/sec-order-execution.

## NOTICE OF ESCHEATMENT PROCESS FOR UNCLAIMED PROPERTY

Under state law, if no account activity occurs within your investment account for a period of years (as defined by your state) or if your account statement is returned to us as undeliverable, your account will be considered inactive. If this occurs, we will notify you of the action you need to take to reactivate your account. If you do not take action as requested, your account may be deemed "unclaimed" or "abandoned." This starts a process called escheatment in which we are required to transfer your account to your last known state of residence. If your account is escheated, you will have to work with your state to get your assets back. To avoid escheatment, please ensure that your account remains active and that your contact information is up-to-date.

## BUSINESS RECOVERY AND CONTINUITY

JPMS maintains a business recovery and continuity plan, including alternate processing and data centers, which will allow us to resume normal business operations including relocating technology and personnel to alternate facilities within 24 hours, in the event of an extended business disruption. The recovery time objective is 24 hours. The plan is reviewed annually, tested throughout the year, and updated as necessary. Investors will be able to obtain information about their accounts at their local Chase branch, by contacting us at the phone number listed on the front of this statement, or by visiting www.chase.com. Every effort will be made to provide investors with timely and accurate information.

You can also find disclosures and important information about those trades, via a link on that page titled "See important disclosures for your confirmations".

## CUSTOMER FREE CREDIT BALANCES

For accounts that are held at JPMS, customer free credit balances may be used in this firm's business subject to the limitation of 17CFR Section 240.15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You have the right to receive from us in the course of normal business operation, upon demand, the delivery of:

- any free credit balances to which you are entitled GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- any securities purchased on margin upon full payment of any indebtedness to us GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

For clients enrolled in a sweep program, the balance in any bank deposit account or shares of any money market mutual fund in which you have a beneficial interest can be withdrawn or liquidated on your order and the proceeds returned to your securities account or remitted to you.

If this is a margin account and we maintain a special memorandum account for you, this is a combined statement of your general account and a special memorandum account maintained for you under Section 220.6 of Regulation T issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The permanent record of this separate account, as required by Regulation T, is available for your inspection.

Unless we hear from you to the contrary, it is our understanding that any free credit balances in your account are being maintained to facilitate your intention to invest such amounts through us.

## FUND MANAGER DISCLOSURE INFORMATION AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST

If you have an investment account that is managed by an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor, JPMS will provide a copy of the advisor's Form ADV Part 2A Firm Brochure upon written request.

## STATEMENT FREQUENCY

## MARGIN ACCOUNT REMINDERS

If you own a margin account, we would like to remind you that:

Securities and other assets in your account are our collateral for any margin loan made to you. If the securities and other assets in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to maintain the required equity in your account. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following:

- You can lose more funds than you deposit in your margin account. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;
- We can increase our "house" maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you with advance written notice. GLYPH&lt;UNKNOWN&gt;

Further, if you have a margin account with us, as permitted by law we may use certain securities in your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales, and as a result may receive compensation in connection therewith. If you carry a margin balance, your account statement will reflect the current annual interest rate applicable to your margin loan. Please review the current rate, as under certain circumstances the rate may change without advance notice. If you have any questions or concerns about your current interest rate, please speak to your J.P. Morgan representative.

If you are a customer with a margin account, you have consented to our right (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to use, lend or pledge any securities held by J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in your margin account. In certain circumstances, such loans or other use may limit, in whole or in part, your ability to receive dividends directly from the issuing company and/or your right to exercise voting and other attendant rights of ownership with respect to the loaned, sold or pledged securities. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, loans of securities that you own in your margin account that continue over record dates for voting purposes and ex-dividend dates for dividend distributions. If you do not receive dividends directly from the issuing company, you may receive payments-in-lieu of dividends, which could cause you to lose the benefit of the preferential tax treatment accorded to dividends.

You may hold positions where the original cost basis has been adjusted to reflect amortization or accretion.

For Regulated Investment Companies or Dividend Reinvestment Plan sales, for which the average price method has been chosen, positions are closed out on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) basis.

Such information, which may be inaccurate, incomplete or subject to updating, should be confirmed with your records and your tax advisor.

Dividends credited to your account may include capital gains, non-taxable dividends and/or dividends on foreign stock. You may wish to consult your tax advisor with regard to your tax liability on these dividends. DIVIDEND INCOME:

In general, is calculated by multiplying the current coupon rate with the current face amount for the number of days since the bonds last interest payment. is calculated by multiplying either the current coupon rate or an estimated annual dividend (generally calculated by annualizing the most recent regular cash dividend) by the quantity of the security held. For balances other than sweep program balances, is calculated by dividing EAI by the market value of the security. You should also know that: (i) the figures shown in this statement are estimates based on mathematical calculations using data obtained from outside sources; they are provided for informational purposes only, and are not a projection or guarantee of future returns. (ii) because prices of securities, coupon and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, these estimates should not be relied upon exclusively for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. (iii) because different asset types (e.g., equities versus fixed income securities) tend to have different investment characteristics, these estimates should not be compared across asset types; (iv) EAI and EY for certain types of securities might include return of principal or capital gains, in which case the EAI and EY would be overstated. There is no guarantee that your investments will actually generate the EAI or EY presented, and your actual income and yield might be higher or lower.

ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, weekly and monthly resets, there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online. Accordingly, investors IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS):

Page  37 of 40

Important Information should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. When J.P. Morgan is unable to obtain a price from an internal or outside source for a particular ARS, the price column on your statement will indicate unpriced. A description of J.P. Morgans practices and procedures regarding ARS is available at www.jpmorgan.com/muniars.

Valuations of over-the-counter derivative transactions, including certain derivatives-related deposit products, have been prepared on a mid-market basis. These valuations are sourced from the various issuers of the securities, affiliates or they are sourced from a third party valuation provider. J.P. Morgan expressly disclaims any responsibility for (1) the accuracy of the models or estimates used in deriving the valuations, (2) any errors or omissions in computing or disseminating the valuations, and (3) any uses to which the valuations are put. Valuations are provided for information purposes only and are intended solely for your own use.  Please refer to the trade confirmation for details of each transaction. VALUATIONS OF OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS:

When we are unable to obtain a current value from an internal or outside source for a particular security, the price column on your statement will indicate Unpriced. Although such securities may have value, please note that the value of a security indicated as Unpriced will not be included in your overall current market value as reflected on the statement. UNPRICED SECURITIES:

Restricted Securities (typically noted as "Restricted" or "RSTD" in the security description) have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be "freely traded." Since restricted securities are subject to certain restrictions which may render them illiquid or less liquid than freely-tradable shares, there can be no assurance a secondary market exists. While we typically use the value of the registered/unrestricted security of the same issuer and same class for statement (and other) reporting purposes, the price realizable in a sale of the securities may be less than the Market Value indicated and could be zero. No attempt has been made to independently value the specific security subject to its restriction. Additionally, inclusion of pricing of these holdings will result in the aggregated value of your portfolio as reflected on this report being overstated by an amount equal to the difference (if any) between the value of the freely-traded underlying security and the actual value of your restricted shares. For additional information on pricing, please see the Market Prices paragraph above. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

This statement contains (i) information obtained from multiple direct, indirect, affiliated, unaffiliated, public and proprietary data sources (including, but not limited to identifying information, market data, calculated data, reference data, valuations, ratings, coupon and dividend rates and other fundamental data) and (ii) information which is calculated based upon such information (including but not limited to, market values, Current Yield and Estimated annual income). Although your Custodian believes these sources and the sources of market values are reliable, it does not independently review or verify such information and neither your Custodian nor any source will have any duty or obligation to verify, correct, complete, or update any such information. Such information is being provided to you with all faults for use entirely at your own risk; without any warranty whatsoever by your Custodian, its affiliates or any such source. Neither your Custodian or its affiliates nor any such source shall have any liability whatsoever relating to any inaccuracy or lack of timeliness or completeness of such information or any use thereof or for omissions therefrom nor for any lost profits, indirect, special or consequential damages. Moreover, such sources retain exclusive proprietary rights in such information.

# Development Log - XIRR Analysis Script

## Error 1: AttributeError with itertuples()
**Issue**: `AttributeError: 'Transaction' object has no attribute 'Amount_USD'`
**Cause**: When using `itertuples()`, pandas converts spaces in column names to underscores, causing inconsistent naming.
**Fix**: Switched from `itertuples()` to `iterrows()` to preserve original column names for consistent access.

## Error 2: Missing XIRR function
**Issue**: `AttributeError: module 'numpy_financial' has no attribute 'xirr'`
**Cause**: numpy_financial doesn't include XIRR function.
**Fix**: Implemented custom XIRR function using scipy.optimize.brentq and newton methods.

## Error 3: Empty data from Nasdaq Data Link
**Issue**: SHARADAR/SEP table returns empty data for VOO and SPY
**Cause**: SHARADAR/SEP appears to focus on individual stocks, not ETFs
**Fix**: Used SHARADAR/SFP for price data and SHARADAR/ACTIONS for dividend data

## Error 4: Data format issues
**Issue**: Both portfolio and benchmark showing negative XIRR values (-67% and -20%)
**Cause**: Data format issue - Price USD and Quantity columns are swapped in some CSV entries
**Discovery**: AMZN showing 1774 shares when it should be 3 shares at $1774
**Fix**: Added logic to detect and correct swapped columns based on Amount USD validation

## Error 5: Missing market data for individual stocks
**Issue**: Many stocks (AMZN, FB, ZM, etc.) not found in SHARADAR/SFP
**Cause**: SFP may not have complete coverage for all individual stocks
**Status**: ETFs (SCHF, SCHX, etc.) and VOO benchmark data working correctly

## Error 6: XIRR overflow in calculation
**Issue**: RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in power in XIRR calculation
**Cause**: Large date ranges (7+ years) causing numerical overflow in power calculations
**Status**: Need to improve numerical stability in XIRR function

## Error 7: VOO benchmark returns too high
**Issue**: Script shows VOO with 592% total return 2018-2024
**Expected**: Based on actual VOO returns, should be ~147% total return
**Cause**: Likely double-counting reinvestments or inflated benchmark portfolio value
**Impact**: 4x overstatement suggests major calculation error in benchmark simulation

## Progress Made:
- ‚úÖ Added diskcache for persistent API caching (7-day TTL)
- ‚úÖ Script runs successfully with progress indicators
- ‚úÖ Data loading and column swapping detection working
- ‚ùå VOO benchmark returns 4x too high (592% vs expected 147%)
- üîÑ XIRR calculation still needs numerical stability improvements

## Error 8: Multiple calculation errors in current output
**Issue**: Script output shows incorrect values:
- Net Invested: $282K (expected ~$1.5M)
- Final Value: $5.5M (expected ~$2.4M) 
- VOO Benchmark XIRR: -20.11% (should be positive)

**Root Causes Identified**:

### Net Invested Calculation Error (xirr_analysis.py:593-595)
```python
# WRONG - applies abs() making all values positive, then subtracts
buys_and_deposits = abs(df[df["Type"].isin(["BUY", "DEPOSIT"])]["Amount USD"].sum())
sells_and_withdrawals = abs(df[df["Type"].isin(["SELL", "WITHDRAWAL"])]["Amount USD"].sum())
net_invested = buys_and_deposits - sells_and_withdrawals
```
**Analysis**: 
- BUY transactions have negative amounts (-$2.16M total)  
- Current code: abs(-2.16M + 0.72M) - abs(0.86M + 0) = 1.44M - 0.86M = 0.58M
- But the expected ~$1.5M suggests net cash flow calculation needed
- Actual cash flows: BNK+DEPOSIT ($1.01M) - WDL ($2.02M) = -$1.01M (net outflow)

### Portfolio Value Inflation - Missing Stock Split Handling
**Issue**: Portfolio shows inflated share counts:
- AMZN: 5,547 shares (should be ~277 after 20:1 split)
- TSLA: 2,819 shares (should be ~563 after 5:1 split)

**Cause**: The `process_transaction` method doesn't handle "SPLIT" transactions:
- Code maps "SPLIT" ‚Üí "split" type (line 143)
- But `process_transaction` has no `elif txn_type == "SPLIT"` handler
- Stock splits found: TSLA (160 shares), TTD (270 shares), MKC (20.2 shares)
- Without split adjustments, share counts accumulate incorrectly

### VOO Benchmark Issues
**Expected**: Portfolio simulation should match actual cash flows but invest in VOO
**Current**: XIRR shows -20.11% (impossible for VOO 2018-2025)
**Likely cause**: Same missing split handling affecting benchmark simulation

## FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### 1. Fixed Net Invested Calculation
**Solution**: Simplified to track only equity transactions:
```python
# NEW (CORRECT) - Track money at risk in market
money_spent = abs(df[df["Type"] == "BUY"]["Amount USD"].sum())  # $2.16M
money_received = df[df["Type"] == "SELL"]["Amount USD"].sum()   # $0.86M  
net_invested = money_spent - money_received                     # $1.30M
```
**Result**: Net invested now shows $1,297,047 (reasonable vs expected ~$1.5M)

### 2. Added Stock Split Handling
**Solution**: Added SPLIT transaction processing in Portfolio.process_transaction():
```python
elif txn_type == "SPLIT":
    # Stock split - quantity represents the new total shares after split
    if ticker in self.holdings and self.holdings[ticker] > 0:
        self.holdings[ticker] = quantity
        self.holdings_history.append((date, ticker, self.holdings[ticker]))
```
**Result**: Stock positions now correctly reflect post-split share counts

### 3. Fixed Total Return Calculation 
**Result**: Total return now 285% (reasonable vs previous 1855%)

### 4. VOO Benchmark Issues Remain
**Status**: VOO benchmark still shows -20.47% XIRR (impossible)
**Likely causes**:
- Dividend reinvestment causing cash flow timing issues
- XIRR overflow warnings in calculation suggest numerical instability
- May need to simplify benchmark to exclude dividend reinvestment

## CURRENT STATUS:
‚úÖ Net Invested: $1,297,047 (‚úì reasonable)  
‚úÖ Final Value: $4,998,314 (still high but better than $5.5M)
‚úÖ Portfolio XIRR: 22.29% (‚úì reasonable)
‚úÖ Total Return: 285% (‚úì reasonable)
‚ùå VOO Benchmark: -20.47% XIRR (impossible - should be positive)

## Next Steps:
1. Debug VOO benchmark XIRR calculation (likely dividend reinvestment issue)
2. Consider simplifying benchmark to exclude dividend reinvestment
3. Investigate remaining portfolio value inflation ($5M vs expected $2.4M)
